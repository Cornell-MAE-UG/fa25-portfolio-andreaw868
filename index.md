## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a current sophomore majoring in Mechanical Engineering, with a focus on Aerospace Engineering. From a young age, I've been drawn to flight, whether that be through air shows near my hometown of San Diego, CA, or going into deep dives on rocket launches. My passion for aerospace has influenced every part of my college experience. This semester, I am taking Intro to Aeronautics, my first non-required technical course. I am also a member of the airframe subteam on CUAir, a student-led project team that designs, builds, and tests a custom fixed-wing VTOL UAV. Last summer, I conducted research at the Cornell Space Structures Lab, harnessing buckling as means to achieve bistability in ultra-thin, ultra-lightweight composite structures for space applications. In my professional career, I hope to continue reaching for the stars.

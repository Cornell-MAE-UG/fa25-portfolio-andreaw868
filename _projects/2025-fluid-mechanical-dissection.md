My group dissected a vacuum cleaner to explain the fluid mechanics that enable it to function. We collected measurements on various components, ranging from the angle of the impeller blades to the length of the tubing and used these to quantify the performance of the vacuum. My contributions included opening the housing containing the impeller during the dissection, as well as performing calculations to characterize the performance of the pump: I calculated the pressure difference generated by the pump, the nondimensional parameters such as the pump specific speed and diameter and related this to radial vs. axial flow, and the efficiency of the pump at different motor speeds.
